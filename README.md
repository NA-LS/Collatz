# Collatz Program:

The collatz.c file contains the serial implementation of the Collatz algorithm and it works well and was tested with a number of size 10^12, which had 1348 hops.
  - To run the program you need to enter a value that you would like to test in the terminal, it will then provide you with the output within a few seconds.

The collatz_parallel.c file contains the parallel implementation of the Collatz algorithm but is incomplete. The program runs but produces the incorrect outputs, I have tried to get it working but was unable to get it working in the given time.

I used C to code the serial implementation and C with the OpenMP library to code the parallel implementation.
